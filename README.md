# Advent of Code 2022

## Day 1 - Javascript

I want to get a bit more comfy in Node and modern Javascript, and start getting my dev environment set up for that.
So solved today's in Node, and tried to actually do it right by making it all async and doing functional array operations.

## Day 2 - Javascript

Nothing too exciting today. It certainly was a thing that could be coded.

## Day 3 - Javascript

Learned a bit about how classes work in Javascript, then didn't use it at all for part 2.

## Day 4 - Javascript

Well that was pretty easy.

## Day 5 - Javascript

The hardest part was definitely just parsing the input.

## Day 6 - Javascript

Nothing too difficult in this one either.

## Day 7 - Javascript

As usual I skipped doing it the *right* way. Instead of building a tree like I think they wanted us to, I just kept an array of both the current working directory and all its parents as I read the file.

Then as I read each file line I could loop through that array and add its size to all of their counters.

I was basically just done (a filter and sum away) once I hit the bottom of reading the file.

## Day 8 - PHP CLI

I tried using a PHP shell script today. It worked pretty well. I'm actually forming the opinion that PHP is a top-tier shell scripting language.

## Day 9 - Javascript

This one actually came together pretty quick for me. I built part one with a class for handling one knot following another, and it was really easy to generalize into as many knots as I liked.

## Day 10 - Javascript

Also wasn't that hard, once I figured out what on Earth the instructions for part two were trying to express. The coding on this one was easy enough. On part two I think I spent like five times as long trying to make sense of the instructions as I did coding it up once I figured out what they meant.

## Day 11 - Javascript

Part one was easy. Part two made me think.
